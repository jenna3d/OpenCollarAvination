OpenCollar - Quick Guide
================

Your prefix are the first letter of your firstname and the first letter of your surname. If you don't have a surname, your surname will always be "Resident".

    - Wendy Starfall (wendy.starfall)'s prefix is: ws
    - wendy4u (wendy4u Resident)'s prefix is: wr
    - ????i? ?l?? (fraulein.fapalot)'s prefix is: ff
 
Your prefix is used to issue commands in the Nearby Chat.
 
    <prefix>menu
    <prefix>pose
    <prefix>kneel
    <prefix>release
    <prefix>grab
    <prefix>yank
    <prefix>unleash
    <prefix>sitnow
 
If you don't like your prefix, you can change it.
 
    wsprefix wen
    wrprefix we
    jsprefix sex
 
You can also issue commands on channel 1.
 
    /1<prefix>menu
 
Or if you don't like channel 1 set a different channel.
 
    <prefix>channel 2
    <prefix>channel 3
    <prefix>channel 69
    <prefix>channel 9001
 
If you are considerate about lag, you can also turn off the Nearby Chat listener.
 
    <prefix>channel -1
 
Your collar also has a safeword which you simply type in the nearby chat. This will lift all RLV resctrictions, unpose, unleash and unlock you. It will also send your Owner a message to check for your well being.
 
    RED
 
RED in capital letters is the default safeword.
 
If that's too hard to remember you can easily change it.

    <prefix>safeword Mayday!
    <prefix>safeword taxi
    <prefix>safeword BANANA

Too much to type? There is also a menu that has buttons for all these many commands. The menu can be opened in multiple ways.

    1. <prefix>menu
    2. Click the collar!
    3. If you use the Sub AO, it's menu has a button.
    4. If you are an Owner, use the Owner HUD.
    
Yay! Now that you know how to use your prefix, your channel, chat commands and the menu, you are ready to find an Owner. If things don't turn out all that great:

    <prefix>runaway
